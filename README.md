# Loops and Strings - Java Lab 6

**Instructions:**
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository locally to your machine.
3. Create a new branch named Feature01.

## Part 1: Loop Execution Analysis

**Objective:**
Analyze the execution of the loop in the Java program [LoopExecAnalysis.java](src/LoopExecAnalysis.java).

1. Create a table showing the values of variables i and n during the execution of the loop and add it as markdown below this question, or as an image in this project.
   
i: 0, n: 4
i: 1, n: 3
i: 2, n: 2

3. Determine the output of the program and state it below.

5. Discuss if you can prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n below this question.
   
Yes, once n is less than or equal to i, it'll become false. 

## Part 2: Square Root Approximation

**Objective:**
Write a method to approximate the square root of a given number.

1. Create a Java file named `src/MySqRoot.java` and implement a method named `squareRoot` (don't use the `Math.sqrt` method) that takes a double parameter "num" and returns an approximation of its square root.
2. Use the provided formula for the approximation (i.e. each guess of $x_n$), your guess for the square root: $$x_1 = \frac{x_0 + \frac{num}{x_0}}{2}$$
    * Hint: This is a loop so $x_1$ is calculated from $x_0$ and $x_2$ is calculated from $x_1$, etc.
    * Hint: An initial guess for the square root (i.e. $x_0$) should be the number you wish to find the square-root for divided by 2.
3. Iterate until two consecutive estimates of the squre root (i.e. your $x_n$'s differ by less than 0.0001.
    * Hint: you can use `Math.abs` to get the absolute value of this difference.

## Part 3: Abecedarian Word Check

**Objective:**
Determine if a word is [abecedarian](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/abecedarian#:~:text=arranged%20in%20alphabetical%20order), which means all the letters in the word occur in alphabetical order.

1. Write a method called `isAbecedarian`, in the [WordChecks.java](src/WordChecks.java) file, that takes a String and returns a boolean indicating whether the word is abecedarian.

## Part 4: Pair Isogram Word Check

**Objective:**
Check if a word is a "Pair [Isogram](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/isogram)", meaning every letter in the word occurs twice.

1. Write a method called `isPairIsogram`, in the [WordChecks.java](src/WordChecks.java) file, that takes a string and checks whether every letter in the word occurs twice.
2. Ignore case.

## Extra Credit: Infinite Series

One way to evaluate $$\exp(-x^2)$$ is to use the infinite series expansion:
$$\exp(-x^2) = 1 - x^2 + \frac{x^4}{2} - \frac{x^6}{6} + \ldots$$

The ith term in this series is $$(-1)^i \cdot \frac{x^{2i}}{i!}$$. Create a Java class `src/InfiniteSeries.java` and write a method named gauss that takes x and n as arguments and returns the sum of the first n terms of the series. You should try **NOT** to write/use the factorial or Math.pow methods respectively.

## Submission
Follow these steps for submission:
1. Create a Feature01 branch of your code if you haven't already.
2. Commit your working code for the exercises to your local copy/Feature01 branch.
3. Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e., GitHub: Feature01 -> origin/Feature01).
4. Issue a Pull request to my instructor repo.
5. **Make sure to COPY the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab/assignment in Canvas.**
